		# The page updates again, and now shows both items on her list.

		# Adeline wonders whether the site will remember her list. Then she sees that
		# the site has generated a unique URL for her -- there is some explanatory text
		# to that effect.

		# She visits that URL - her applications are still there.

		# Satisfied, she goes back to sleep
