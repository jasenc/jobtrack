# Job Track

Have you ever been overwhelmed by the sheer number of positions you have applied
to, which one was which, is the person emailing you back from a top 10 company
or a bottom 5 company?

Job searching can take a long time, you might apply to a position and finally hear
back from the company six months later or a day later. You never know what
you're going to get and its challenging to stay organized.

on top of your job search.
